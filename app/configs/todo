v3.5 (Youtube integration):
    ✔ figure out what youtube overlay to use @done(25-05-16 14:22)
        ✔ maybe we can somehow get the current live chat from the youtube handle? (test.ts has an implementation to get the current live chat with just the channel id) @done(25-05-16 14:23)
    ✔ check what styling options are available @done(25-05-18 14:55)
        ✔ there's something called "chat v2", might be useful https://chatv2.septapus.com/ @done(25-05-18 14:55)

v3.6.3 (code cleanup):
    ☐ refactor settings pages, we have so much duplicated code (looking at you success enabling functions)

    ☐ cleanup translation files, lots of duplicated messages which can be combined probably

v3.6.4 (small features):
    ☐ jchat custom fonts
    ☐ hotkey for clearing chat (not sure yet how to do that properly)

v3.7 (Multistream):
    ☐ keep all the current functionality

    New window handler:
        ☐ should draw a window on the whole screen (transparent)
        ☐ should be able to add dragable chat "widgets" to the window
            ☐ widgets should get their own unique id (can be defined by the user)
            ☐ should determine which widgets are available based on the previous user input
                ☐ stream selection button or somthing similar
        ☐ toggle to move the widgets around (similar to vanish mode)
        ☐ needs to create a new config for this type of window
            ☐ should be able to save the current layout (widget position, size, etc.)
